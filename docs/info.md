## How it works

This is a three-channel square wave synthesizer. It outputs the audio wave as a PWM signal on a pin. It accepts 2 PWM inputs per channel to control frequency and volume.

## How to test

The design is tested with ChiselTest.

## External hardware

A breadboard with potentiometer and also a poor-man's ADC is needed.
